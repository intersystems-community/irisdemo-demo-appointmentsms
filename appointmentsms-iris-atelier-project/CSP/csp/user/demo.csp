			<p>
			To run this demo you must have a Twitter Developer account and and a twitter application created on twitter. 
			The application will provide you with your <b>Consumer API Keys</b> and <b>Access token & access token secret</b> credentials.</p>
			
			<p>Start the process of getting the developer account WEEKS BEFORE you decide to give this demo. There is no formula to getting a 
			twitter developer account. They are very strict about giving developer accounts to people. You can try opening one
			with your personal e-mail account, telling them that you are studying the Twitter API and that you don't have an application in mind right now. 
			Or you can say that you are a consultant that is studying a 
			<a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/developer-utilities/twitter-libraries.html">twitter library</a> and need a developer
			account to do some tests (I like this better). They will ask you what is the nature of your business or customer. They are very worried about you how
			you are going to use twitter data. Governamental organizations scare them to death. Try to give them piece of mind. You are just learning a library.</p>
			
			<p>Once you have a developer account, create a simple Twitter App using their portal. Click on the <b>Details</b> button of your new 
			application and click on the <b>Keys and Tokens</b> tab. You will see your <b>Consumer API Keys</b> and <b>Access token & access token secret</b> credentials.</p>

			<p>Now that you have your Twitter credentials, click on <b>Start Demo</b>. Many tabs will be opened for you. If that doesn't happen or
			just a single tab has been opened, check to see if your browser has blocked your popups.
			If it has, tell it to allow popups and close any tab that has been opened before trying clickin on the <b>Start Demo</b>
			button again.</p>

			<p>You will realize that the first screen is actually the Twitter Developer portal. If you are already logged in, you should be 
			looking at the list of applications on your twitter account. You should navigate to your keys and copy and paste them on the next
			browser tab. The next browser tab is the list of IRIS Credentials. There are two credentials that you need to configure:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>TwitterAppConsumerCredentials</b>:
					<ul>
						<li><b>User Name</b>: The API Key of your Consumer API keys </li>
						<li><b>Password</b>: The API Secret Key of your Consumer API keys </li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><b>TwitterAppUserTokenCredentials</b>:
					<ul>
						<li><b>User Name</b>: The Access Token of your Access token & access token secret</li>
						<li><b>Password</b>: The Access Token Secret of your Access token & access token secret</li>
					</ul>

				</li>
			</ul>  
			
			<p>After configuring your credentials, close the Twitter and the Credentials tab and jump to the production tab and 
			restart the Twitter Business Service. Leave this tab open.</p>
			
			<p><b>Now you are ready to give the demo!</b> Jump to the first tab (the one with this explanation) and use the graph on
			it to explain what they are going to see on the demo.</p> 
			
			<p>We are using IRIS Interoperability to stream tweets using the standard Twitter Streaming API. This API is different from the 
			Search API because we can receive the tweets in real time. It is also different from the Firehose Streaming API because we are not receiving 
			all the tweets but a fraction that will depend on the traffic. But for many applications such as sentiment analysis that is just fine.</p>
			
			<p>It is important to be prepared to show knowledge about the difference between the Search API, Streaming API and the Firehose API because
			someone may challenge you. But it is also important to remember that:<p>
			<ul>
			 	<li>Receiving a fraction of the tweets in real time is much better than serching for a fraction of yesterday's tweets 
			 		(Search API takes time to index tweets). If you need realtime reaction (as in the case of
			sentiment analysis) you can't use Search. You have to do Streaming. </li>
				<li>This is not a Twitter API demo. This is an NLP demo. We are using Twitter to make it even fun.</li>
				<li>You are not a Twitter expert. No one is expecting you to be one. So don't try looking like one. This is an IRIS Demo. 
					We are using cool stuff to demo our product. That's it. We want to show our NLP capabilities as well as our business
					orchestration, governance and integration capabilities.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>On this demo, a ficticious organization that sells electronic devices such as phones wants to be alerted if someone starts
			saying something bad aboud their products on social media. The reaction must be in real time and the callcenter must reach out
			to the person in the social media to see if it is possible to help the person and mitigate the damage he/she is doing to the brand.</p>
			 
			<p>Every tweet that comes in, triggers a process on the service layer. The first thing this process does is to store the tweet in an
			IRIS Database that can scale. The second thing is to ask the database for the sentiment score of that tweet. IRIS Database has NLP support and can do 
			that for us as a service. </p>
			
			<p>With the sentiment score, the process applies business rules to decide if we should open a ticket
			on the callcenter to reach out to that person on the social networks and mitigate any damage they may be doing to our brand. 
			We don't want to loose our time with users that are not really damaging our brand. So users with few followers or tweets that
			haven't been retweeted a lot don't really matter. These are business rules that can be configured on IRIS!</p>
			
			<p>With all the tweets being stored on the database, our data scientists can continue to refine IRIS NLP performance. Having
			all past tweets also helps us to do traditional analytics that could cross reference how the market reacted to our product
			launches, campaigns, etc.</p>

			<p>After following the instructions to copy and paste your credentials from twitter into IRIS, and closing the twitter and credentials tabs,
			the next tab after the demo landing page is the production tab. You should start telling your story there, and then clik on each tab 
			and explain what is it accordingly to the followin script:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					On the production tab, explain what services, processes and operations are.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Click on the green circle of the business service that receives the tweets from Twitter and show that it is configured
							to filter tweets that contain the hash tag #irisdemo.</li>
						<li>Call their attention to the dependency on the Business Process.</li>
						<li>Click on the green circle of the business process. Show them how the other dependencies are shown by IRIS.
						    Explain that this process is taking the tweet and storing it on the IRIS database on the next layer and asking for the sentiment score.</li>
						<li>Depending on the sentiment score, number of followers of the user who sent the tweet and how many reteweets, 
							we will notify the callcenter or not.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>Now show the Business Process tab. Show them how complex processes can be designed in a low code aproach that is
					easy to understand and to maintain. Synchronous and Asynchronous activities, calling business rules, data transformations, 
					initiating human workflows, sending alerts, all can be easily designed here.</li>
				<li>Show that the process is calling a business rule to decide if this is worthy of the attention of our call center or not.</li>
				<li>Jump to the Business Rule tab and show them the rules.</li>
				
				<li>Jump to the message trace tab. Tell them that here is
					where they can query our audit logs. Click on the last message just to leave it checked.</li>
					
				<li>Now use your phone to tweet something like: "My phone says the weather will be dreadful today. #irisdemo". It must contain the hash tag #irisdemo!</li>

				<li>Click on the Search button of the message trace screen. Show them that a new tweet just came in. It is your tweet! In real time!</li>
				
				<li>Show how much data this tweet brings! Everything about you, number of followers, retweets, etc. Remember them that we are using
					all of this to make a decision, but we are throwing sentiment in there too!</li>
				
				<li>Show them the visual trace. This is one of the most important screens! Explore this trace with them. Governance.
					Auditing. Evidence for solving conflictive problems. It may not be so important in the context of NLP, but when integrating
					critical systems on an organization, that is the tool you want to have always available for you. Tell them that they can choose 
					to store as many months or years of message as they need. Tell them that we have a message bank component
					that allows them to keep their production systems small (and stateless) while keeping with all the messages
					on a message bank that is searchable and allow you to resend messages if necessary. Focus on the concepts that
					you think are important for this customer.</li>

				<li>Show that the process evaluated the sentiment of your tweet as NEGATIVE. The fact that the word "phone" was mentioned made it 
				very negative. If you send a different tweet such as "The weather today will be dreadful. #irisdemo", you will notice that the score
				will be a lot smaller. That is because we are not mentioning the word "phone" that is a business concept for us!</li>
				
				<li>Jump to the next tab and explain to them the Domain Architect. Show them where you can configure a Matching dictionary
				with business concepts and its synonyms.</li>
				
				<li>Click on the "Domain Settings" and show all the languages our NLP support.</li>
				
				<li>Click on "TableTwitter" under "Data Locations" and show them how we told our NLP engine where to find the data.</li>
				<li>Explain other concepts as you please accordingly to your audience. Always try to limit the explanation accordingly to the time you have 
				 	and the audience.</li>
				 	
				<li>Jump to the next tab and show the Domain Explorer and refresh it. Show how the sentences on your tweet were highlighted. If you send another tweet such 
				as "This is not such a bad phone after all. #irisdemo" you can show how the negation support on our NLP engine prevents us from giving this
				sentence a negative score.</li>
				
				<li>Now jump to the call center tab and refresh it. You should see a ticket there for your first tweet. Explain that this is just a legacy
					application that we are integrating with through SOAP. This is an application built on JBoss and Primefaces (it is using IRIS as a database with Hybernate).</li>
				<li>Go back to the first screen (the demo landing page). And finish there, reviewing with them what they just saw.</li>
				
				<li>You can send another tweet with a negation such as "This is not such a bad weather! #irisdemo" and show how our negation score prevented us from interpreting
				this as a negative sentiment.</li> 
			</ol>
